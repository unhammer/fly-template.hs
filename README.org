* Template for fly.io docker build using Github actions

1. Make an account on fly.io
2. Download flyctl
3. Think of an app name and enter it into =fly.toml=
4. Initial launch of the app with =fly launch=
   - say Yes to copying the existing configuration to the new app
   - say No to the rest; you can always run =fly launch= again, or
     =fly deploy= if you've built and loaded the docker image locally
     and want to just deploy from your own machine (see comment in
     [[file:docker.nix][docker.nix]] on how to do that)
5. On fly.io, generate a fly access token (Account â†’ Access Tokens)
6. On github.com, add the fly access token to your repo's Action
   Secrets at https://github.com/USER/PROJECT/settings/secrets/actions
   as a /Repository secret/ with the name =FLY_API_TOKEN=
7. Merge into the =deploy= branch and push, Github will build and
   deploy
8. Your app should soon be available at
   https://myflyapp.fly.dev/index.html (or whatever name you chose)
